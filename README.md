## Introduction

This project is part of the Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) for the Programming 2A module (**PROG6221**). The application allows users to manage recipes, including adding ingredients, steps, and nutritional information. It also includes advanced filtering features.

The application is built using **C#** and **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**, following object-oriented programming principles.

- Scale recipes by factors of **0.5, 2, or 3**.
- Reset ingredient quantities to original values.
- Clear all data to enter a new recipe.

### Advanced Features:
