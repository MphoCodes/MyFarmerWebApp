## Introduction

This project is part of the Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) for the Programming 2A module (**PROG6221**). The application allows users to manage recipes, including adding ingredients, steps, and nutritional information. It also includes advanced filtering features.

The application is built using **C#** and **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**, following object-oriented programming principles.

## Features

### Core Functionalities:
- Add unlimited recipes with names, ingredients, and cooking steps
- Display recipes in alphabetical order
- Enter calories and food groups for each ingredient
- Calculate and display total calories for each recipe
- Notify the user when a recipe exceeds 300 calories
- Scale recipes by factors of **0.5, 2, or 3**
- Reset ingredient quantities to original values
- Clear all data to enter a new recipe

### Advanced Features:
- **Filter recipes** by:
  - Ingredient name
  - Food group
  - Maximum calorie count
- Create menus and display a **pie chart** showing the percentage of each food group in the total menu
